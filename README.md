# MyWays-frontend

This project is for an assignment given by MyWays for internship.
This is a blog site for MyWays and I have done everything I could in 24 hrs. There is no more time left to make it mobile responsive and I couldn't add like and comment feature due to time constraints.
I have added create and delete feature for the admin.
The new admin has to be manually given permission in the database.
admin email- admin@gmail.com
admin password - admin123
Other users can read the blogs.
